Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


For RNG rolls, either each racer needs its own individual rng timers so checks can only be made every half a second or so, or there needs to be a global timer that runs out and resets every half second, and when that timer resets, a check CAN be made with individual odds
def self.rngRoll(chance) #chance being maybe 50 (out of 100 is assumed)
this can only be called when the global timer resets, making all checks that require rng will do nothing unless it's been half a second
return rand(100).between?(1..chance) <- this would return true if you hit a number between 1 and 50 if using the example above


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:

When to use invincible:
Use if available and there's a hazard coming up?

When to use spinOut:
Use when in max range of another racer if it's ready, rng very likely to use if ready

When to use overload:
Use when in max range of another racer if it's ready, rng very likely to use if ready

When to use reduceCooldown:
Use whenever, unlikely to use

When to use secondBoost:
Use if boost cooldown greater than 0 but speed is less than what stabilize would give?

When to use rockHazard:
Use whenever, rolling RNG to use if they have it readied
Prefer using this and rock hazard if in front of another racer, regardless of how far away on the X axis the other racer is

When to use mudHazard:
Use whenever, rolling RNG to use if they have it readied
Prefer using this and rock hazard if in front of another racer, regardless of how far away on the X axis the other racer is

When to strafe:
Try to strafe out of the way of a hazard if it's within range
Roll rng with a change of not moving out of the way
Do not bother moving if invincible
Strafe towards someone if within max range X of an attack and they just need to get closer to use it







change spinout speed to be -2 or something and then add the spinout speed to the current base speed or current boosting speed depending on what they are doing
need to move buttons back to the left because there can be up to 4 moves
separate boost length in seconds and stabilize boost length in seconds so stabilize lasts longer
