Notes to self:
Move summary is handled in plugin for Gen 3 Contests, in Summary.rb


For RNG rolls, either each racer needs its own individual rng timers so checks can only be made every half a second or so, or there needs to be a global timer that runs out and resets every half second, and when that timer resets, a check CAN be made with individual odds
def self.rngRoll(chance) #chance being maybe 50 (out of 100 is assumed)
this can only be called when the global timer resets, making all checks that require rng will do nothing unless it's been half a second
return rand(100).between?(1..chance) <- this would return true if you hit a number between 1 and 50 if using the example above


Alright, organizing my thoughts for AI:

When to use invincible:
Use if available and there's a hazard coming up or if someone is within range of them and charging their spin out move

When to use overload:
Use when in max range of another racer if it's ready, rng very likely to use if ready

When to use reduceCooldown:
Use whenever, unlikely to use

When to use secondBoost:
Use if boost cooldown greater than 0 but speed is less than what stabilize would give?

When to use rockHazard:
Use whenever, rolling RNG to use if they have it readied
Prefer using this and rock hazard if in front of another racer, regardless of how far away on the X axis the other racer is

When to use mudHazard:
Use whenever, rolling RNG to use if they have it readied
Prefer using this and rock hazard if in front of another racer, regardless of how far away on the X axis the other racer is

When to strafe:
Do not bother avoiding obstacles if invincible




Add part of the track that slow you down, and make AI bad at avoiding it or maybe not try to avoid (maybe with RNG rolls?)

separate boost length in seconds and stabilize boost length in seconds so stabilize lasts longer
